          <h2>Workshop Aims and Scope</h2>

          <!--<p>Creating efficient and effective <strong>search and recommendation algorithms</strong> has been the main objective of industry practitioners and academic researchers over the years.
             However, recent research has shown how these algorithms trained on historical data lead to models that might <strong>exacerbate existing biases</strong> and generate potentially
             negative outcomes. Defining, assessing and mitigating these biases throughout experimental pipelines is a primary step for devising search and recommendation algorithms that can be
             <strong>responsibly deployed</strong> in real-world applications. This workshop aims to collect novel contributions in this field and offer a common ground for interested researchers and practitioners.</p>-->

            <p> The goal is hence to favor a <strong>community-wide dialogue on new research perspectives</strong> through a workshop having the following objectives: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Increase awareness of the algorithmic bias problem in IR.</li>
              <li>Identify dimensions influenced by algorithmic bias in IR.</li>
              <li>Solicit contributions addressing algorithmic bias in IR. </li>
              <li>Gain insights into recent advances and open issues in IR.</li>
              <li>Familiarize the IR community with current field practices.</li>
              <li>Uncover gaps in academic and industry research in IR.</li>

			 <p><strong>Title</strong>: Fair Ranking Systems: What's Missing?</p>

             <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Many approaches to fairness in ranking center on algorithms, metrics, and data. Will focusing solely on these factors allow us to create equitable systems in practice? This talk will explore three issues that might influence the effectiveness of fairness interventions. First, we'll examine tensions between fairness and other responsibility principles mandated by data protection laws. Second, we'll demonstrate the role of interface design in the societal outcomes of a ranking platform. Finally, we'll conclude with a reflection on the importance and practical outcomes of normatively grounding our fairness metrics.</p>

			 <p><strong>Title</strong>: Algorithmic Impact Practices in Product Development</p>

             <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: When organizations want to assess their algorithmic impact, more is required than research alone. Unintended negative side effects of Machine Learning are gaining attention. Using historical data can perpetuate stereotypes, machine models and recommendations can amplify existing inequalities. However, pragmatic challenges stand in the way of practitioners that are committed to address these issues. There are no clear, off-the-shelf industry-standard processes that can be readily applied in practice on what negative impacts to assess, or how to address them. Barriers include the extensive research necessary to understand domain-specific issues, turning that research into the development of concrete methods to assess and address those issues, and challenges to implementing solutions at an organizational scale and in large infrastructures. This includes translation between Product, Trust & Safety and Algorithmic Impact communities. In this talk, I’ll share lessons learnt from both organizational and technical practice that could be useful for others trying to address such challenges in product development, and for those that study algorithmic impact methods academically.</p>

             <p><strong>Short Bio</strong>: Henriette Cramer is Head of Algorithmic Impact, and a Director in Spotify’s Trust & Safety team. Her current work focuses on assessing and addressing the impact of data, platform and machine learning decisions in music and podcast streaming. This includes translating abstract calls to action into concrete structure and tooling at organizational scale, as well as data-informed product direction. Henriette has experience in a variety of Product, Policy and Research settings, ranging from exploratory human-robot interaction in academia to practical search, voice, advertising and recommender systems in product settings. This makes her especially interested in how different fields, functions and domains diverge in histories and incentives, and how that impacts collaboration. Henriette has a PhD from the University of Amsterdam focused on people’s interaction with adaptive and autonomous systems, a collection of patent filings related to her industry work, and 50+ peer-reviewed academic publications, which can be found at henriettecramer.com.</p>

			 <p><strong>Title</strong>: Counterfactual Learning to Rank for Search and Recommendation</p>

             <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Search and recommendation systems are vital for the accessibility of content on the internet. The basis for these systems are ranking models that turn collections of items into rankings: small, ordered lists of items to be displayed to users. Modern ranking models are mostly optimized based on user interactions. Generally, learning from user behavior leads to systems that receive more user engagement than those optimized based on expert judgements. However, user interactions are biased indicators of user preference: often whether something is interacted has less to do with preference and more with where and how it was presented. In response to this bias problem, recent years have seen the introduction and development of the counterfactual Learning to Rank (LTR) field. This field covers methods that learn from historical user interactions, i.e. click logs, and aim to optimize ranking models in terms of the actual user preferences. In order to achieve this goal, counterfactual LTR methods have to correct the biases that affect clicks. In this talk, I will compare counterfactual estimation for bandit algorithms with methods specifically made for learning to rank. Additionally, I will introduce a recently introduced doubly robust method for correcting position-bias in user interactions with rankings.</p>

             <p><strong>Short Bio</strong>: Harrie Oosterhuis is an assistant professor at the Data Science Group of the Institute of Computing and Information Sciences (iCIS) of the Radboud University. His research lies on the intersection of machine learning and information retrieval, it primarily concerns learning from user interactions on rankings. In particular, it focuses on methods that correct for the effects of interaction biases. He received his PhD cum laude from the University of Amsterdam under supervision of prof. dr. Maarten de Rijke on the thesis titled "Learning from User Interactions with Rankings: A Unification of the Field". He is also a recipient of the 2021 Google Research Scholar Award for early career researchers and the WSDM'21, SIGIR'21 and ICTIR'22 best paper awards.</p>
